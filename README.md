# Simple mathemetic v2

## What is it?
It is a simple mathematic app with addition and subtraction for children and some older kids around 10 years.
Based on my first Simple mathematic, this have count and some other feutures.

On desktop it has a locked size and on smaller screens it fills the screen.

I created this app in the start of our javascript course, and updated it before end 2020.

## How does it work?
There is an random number function that choose the numbers and the second number is never larger than the first one.

There are two colors for each mathtype.
When you´ve got an correct answer the display turns all green.
But if you answer the wrong answer all the screen turns red until the correct answer.

- You can switch between these two modes.
- There are 5 difficulty levels that loop with the button "Högre tal".
  - Numbers between 20, 40, 100, 200, 400
- It displays number of correct- and wrong answers.
- Reset button "Nollställ"
- There are local storage that safes the count of correct- and wrong answers
  - The reset button clears all the local storage
